## [Introduction](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a [community-maintained library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/community-libraries).

To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:

To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:

```
npm install openai@^4.0.0
```

[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

## [Authentication](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```

[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/organization-optional)

### [Organization (optional)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/organization-optional)

For users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's subscription quota.

Example curl command:

```

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: org-fCjgkQdhhwrfvZe34uBrCCfN"
```

Example with the `openai` Python package:

```py
import os
import openai
openai.organization = "org-fCjgkQdhhwrfvZe34uBrCCfN"
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Model.list()
```

Example with the `openai` Node.js package:

```

import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
    organization: "org-fCjgkQdhhwrfvZe34uBrCCfN",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.listEngines();
```

Organization IDs can be found on your [Organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings) page.

[](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests)

## [Making requests](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests)

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
```

This request queries the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model (which under the hood points to the [latest `gpt-3.5-turbo` model variant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)) to complete the text starting with a prompt of "_Say this is a test_". You should get a response back that resembles the following:

```
{
    "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1677858242,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "completion_tokens": 7,
        "total_tokens": 20
    },
    "choices": [
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "\n\nThis is a test!"
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Now that you've generated your first chat completion, let's break down the [response object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object). We can see the `finish_reason` is `stop` which means the API returned the full chat completion generated by the model without running into any limits. In the choices list, we only generated a single message but you can set the `n` parameter to generate multiple messages choices.

## [Create transcription](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription)

post https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### Request body

The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

ID of the model to use. Only `whisper-1` is currently available.

An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/prompting) should match the audio language.

The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt.

The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format will improve accuracy and latency.

### Returns

## [Create chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)

post https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### Request body

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

Controls how the model calls functions. "none" means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. "auto" means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present.

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.

If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to generate in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them.

The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to generate in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for counting tokens.

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

How many completions to generate for each prompt.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).

Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.

Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

**Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

post https://api.openai.com/v1/fine-tunes

Creates a job that fine-tunes a specified model from a given dataset.

Response includes details of the enqueued job including job status and the name of the fine-tuned models once complete.

[Learn more about fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning)

### Request body

The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.

See [upload file](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each training example is a JSON object with the keys "prompt" and "completion". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.

See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/creating-training-data) for more details.

The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data.

If you provide this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning. These metrics can be viewed in the [fine-tuning results file](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/analyzing-your-fine-tuned-model). Your train and validation data should be mutually exclusive.

Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file, where each validation example is a JSON object with the keys "prompt" and "completion". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.

See the [fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/creating-training-data) for more details.

The name of the base model to fine-tune. You can select one of "ada", "babbage", "curie", "davinci", or a fine-tuned model created after 2022-04-21 and before 2023-08-22. To learn more about these models, see the [Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) documentation.

The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset.

The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training examples used to train a single forward and backward pass.

By default, the batch size will be dynamically configured to be ~0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at 256 - in general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.

The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning learning rate is the original learning rate used for pretraining multiplied by this value.

By default, the learning rate multiplier is the 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 depending on final `batch_size` (larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes). We recommend experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results.

The weight to use for loss on the prompt tokens. This controls how much the model tries to learn to generate the prompt (as compared to the completion which always has a weight of 1.0), and can add a stabilizing effect to training when completions are short.

If prompts are extremely long (relative to completions), it may make sense to reduce this weight so as to avoid over-prioritizing learning the prompt.

If set, we calculate classification-specific metrics such as accuracy and F-1 score using the validation set at the end of every epoch. These metrics can be viewed in the [results file](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/analyzing-your-fine-tuned-model).

In order to compute classification metrics, you must provide a `validation_file`. Additionally, you must specify `classification_n_classes` for multiclass classification or `classification_positive_class` for binary classification.

The number of classes in a classification task.

This parameter is required for multiclass classification.

The positive class in binary classification.

This parameter is needed to generate precision, recall, and F1 metrics when doing binary classification.

If this is provided, we calculate F-beta scores at the specified beta values. The F-beta score is a generalization of F-1 score. This is only used for binary classification.

With a beta of 1 (i.e. the F-1 score), precision and recall are given the same weight. A larger beta score puts more weight on recall and less on precision. A smaller beta score puts more weight on precision and less on recall.

A string of up to 40 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.

For example, a `suffix` of "custom-model-name" would produce a model name like `ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04`.

  }
}
```

post https://api.openai.com/v1/edits

Creates a new edit for the provided input, instruction, and parameters.

### Request body

ID of the model to use. You can use the `text-davinci-edit-001` or `code-davinci-edit-001` model with this endpoint.

The input text to use as a starting point for the edit.

The instruction that tells the model how to edit the prompt.

How many edits to generate for the input and instruction.

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

### Returns

```python

import os
import openai
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Edit.create(
  model="text-davinci-edit-001",
  input="What day of the wek is it?",
