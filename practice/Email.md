**Can you write me an email to a colleague that explains that I need iterative feedback on my prototype until the end of the current sprint (that ends this week). Explain politely that I've never worked with the Django backend on this project and that while the code I wrote works in isolation I will need help thinking of test cases to integrate it into the existing framework on this porject.**

Subject: Request for Iterative Feedback on Prototype

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the prototype I've been working on for our current sprint, which, as you know, concludes at the end of this week.

Given the tight timeline and the importance of ensuring our work integrates seamlessly, I was hoping to get iterative feedback from you on my contributions. While I've ensured that the code I've written functions well in isolation, I'm venturing into unfamiliar territory with the Django backend on this project. Your expertise and insights would be invaluable in helping me think of test cases and ensuring that my work integrates smoothly into our existing framework.

I understand that everyone is juggling multiple tasks, especially as we approach the sprint's end. However, your feedback, even if brief, would greatly assist in ensuring the quality and compatibility of my work with the broader project.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support. I truly appreciate your guidance and collaboration on this.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
